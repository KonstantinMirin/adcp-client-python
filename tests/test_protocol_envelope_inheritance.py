"""Every response arm carries the root ``allOf`` protocol envelope (#1136).

Each AdCP response schema composes ``core/protocol-envelope.json`` at its root
via ``allOf``, so ``status``, ``task_id``, ``message``, ``context_id``,
``replayed``, ``timestamp``, ``push_notification_config``,
``governance_context``, ``context``, ``payload`` and ``adcp_error`` are part of
every response's contract — on the success arm, the error arm and the submitted
arm alike. The code generator used to attach :class:`ProtocolEnvelope` only to
the ``status: submitted`` arm, leaving those fields untyped on the rest: a
seller that set one wrote a pydantic extra and a buyer that read one got an
``AttributeError``.
