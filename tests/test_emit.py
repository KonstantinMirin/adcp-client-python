"""Grade the committed emitted tree against the documents it was emitted from.

Every assertion here is over something DERIVED: the population comes from the
bundle, the pairs come from the classes' own ``__adcp_schema__``, and the verdict
comes from the harness.  There is no expected class list, no snapshot and no
blessed value, so a test that passes cannot be passing because someone recorded
what the tree happened to hold (P10).

**There is no adapter and no binding table.**  Both existed to tell the harness
which document a class was generated from, and an indirection that can be aimed
at a tree can be aimed at the WRONG tree -- which is how a previous attempt came
to grade 1,602 documents green while generating nothing.  Now a class carries its
own schema reference, so ``pairs`` reads the pairing off the class and the
"grading someone else's tree" failure has no site.  What remains is a STALE
module -- one an earlier run wrote and no current document produces -- and that
is caught where P10 puts a check: ``test_the_committed_tree_is_what_a_fresh_run_emits``
compares the whole tree with a fresh emission of the derived population, so a file
no run produces is a failure at the gate.

The bundle directory is a constant here and nowhere inside ``codegen/``: step 10
derives it from ``adcp.get_adcp_spec_version()`` (D9, P9).

    The previous attempt's whole premise was that three generators all flatten a

    step has to make falsifiable.  Two halves, because either alone passes while
    the other fails:

      * the referencing field's annotation NAMES the target's symbol and carries
        no CONSTRAINT -- a copy of the target's constraints is a ``Field(ge=...,
        min_length=...)``, and a copy that replaced the reference does not name
        the symbol at all;
      * no ``Field`` kwarg ANYWHERE in the module is one this document does not
        declare locally -- so a constraint of the target has nowhere else in the
        module to hide either.

    The first half used to assert the annotation contained no CALL, which was the
    same claim only while the renderer dropped the property's own
    ``description``.  draft-07 says a ``$ref`` ignores its siblings and
    ``resolve_all_refs`` MERGES them, so the resolved document the class names
    carries the sibling description -- and a renderer that drops it drops a fact
    the document states.  The compiler carries it, as ``Field(description=...)``,
    which is a call in the annotation and not a copy of anything.  So the
    assertion is on the kwarg NAMES, which is what "copies no constraint" means.

    Deliberately says nothing about HOW an optional property is wrapped.  That is
    D4's, it has been re-decided once already, and a test naming the wrapper's
    spelling would have to be edited by the lane that changes it -- which is how
    a P2 instrument comes to be adjusted by someone who is not grading P2.

    the symbol from the target module's own ``__all__``, the local constraint set
