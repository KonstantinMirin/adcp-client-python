"""A ``Legacy*`` name is the generated class, and there is one per response arm.

Two defects, one cause: the ``Legacy*`` set was curated by hand, so what it
named drifted from what the generator emits.

#1398 — ``adcp.types.LegacyFormatId`` was a SUBCLASS of the generated
``FormatReferenceStructuredObject``, and no public name on ``adcp.types``
resolved to the generated class at all. The subclass redeclared four fields and
every redeclaration had become a weakening of the parent it was written to
narrow: ``width: 300.0`` validated against the class the SDK's own model fields
declare and was refused by the public name for it. A public name more permissive
(or less) than the library's own contract fails late and for no visible reason.

#1399 — ``LegacyUpdateMediaBuy{Success,Error}Response`` shipped while
``LegacyUpdateMediaBuySubmittedResponse`` and all three
``LegacyCreateMediaBuy*Response`` arms did not, so four response arms could only
be named through ``adcp.types.domains.media_buy.*_response`` — the private tree
this release exists to retire. Adding four names would have fixed four
instances: the generator had ALREADY opened a fifth, by adding a fourth
``preview_creative`` arm that nobody named.

So neither test reads a list. Both derive what the surface must carry from the
generated tree:

* the arms of a response union come from ``typing.get_args`` of the union the
  generated module itself declares — not from a name pattern, and not from
  ``__module__`` (which names the canonical spec even for a duplicate, and so
  cannot tell a copy from the original);
* a response is "on the ``Legacy*`` surface" when its tool has any ``Legacy*``
  name at all, which is what an adopter migrating through those names has;
* and the obligation is stated as object identity against ``adcp.types``, which
  is the only thing an adopter's ``isinstance`` cares about.

    * ``__module__.startswith(domains)`` alone is defeated by one line
