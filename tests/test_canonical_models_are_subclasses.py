"""A canonical public model is a SUBCLASS of the generated wire model (#1368).

The canonical layer used to build its 32 public classes with ``create_model``,
copying ``model_fields`` off the generated model and inheriting nothing from it.
That is why PR #1368's injected ``enforce_root_required_groups`` validator
reached the generated class and never the public one — the blocking review
finding on that PR. ARCH-ONE-SURFACE §6 refuses a second injection mechanism
for the copy layer ("it fixes the finding by doubling the thing that caused
it"), so the copy is gone instead.

These tests grade the replacement as a property rather than as a diff:

* every public canonical model descends from a generated wire model;
* every ``model_validator`` the generated model declares is present on the
  public model — which is the #1368 contract, stated for ALL validators rather
  than for one;
* the two concerns the copy had to re-attach per class (the boundary's
  ``extra="allow"`` and the legacy-identity strip) still hold.

Reverting any canonical model to a copy fails the first test, because
``create_model`` stamps the calling module onto what it builds and the copy has
no generated ancestor at all.
