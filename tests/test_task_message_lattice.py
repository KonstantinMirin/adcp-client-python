"""The request/response lattice: every registered task message is a typed AdCP message.

A caller that holds a request should be able to resolve its account, decide at-most-once,
echo its context and negotiate version before knowing which tool it is; a caller that
holds a response should be able to route on task state and split envelope from payload the
same way. That needs the task messages to share a TYPE, which is what ``AdcpRequest`` and
``AdcpResponse`` are -- and ``issubclass(model, AdcpRequest)`` is then the
registration-time proof that a model is spec-derived rather than a hand-written parallel
(a field test passes for a forged model; descent does not).

The ratchet below is what keeps that true across a schema bump. Each envelope residue is
pinned to the exact set of schemas measured to lack the ancestry, with the upstream issue
that owns it, and the assertions are equality: a schema that regains the ancestry fails
until its entry is REMOVED, and a schema that loses it fails with its own name. Residues
shrink; they never grow.
