"""Enforce the type-import layering rule documented in CLAUDE.md.

``adcp.types._generated`` is the one internal namespace left: it binds a bare
type name that several generated modules define to a single winner, chosen by
module sort order. Only the type facade/override modules that build the public
surface — ``aliases.py``, ``capabilities.py``, ``_eager.py``, and the public
``adcp.types/__init__.py`` composer — may import from it. Every other module
under ``src/adcp/`` imports types via ``adcp.types``, or from the domain module
that declares the name when the flat namespace cannot bind it.

The rule exists because that single winner is not the schema's choice: a schema
addition can repoint a bare name, and the only trace is a line in a regenerated
file.

The generated tree is NOT on this list. ``adcp.types.domains.<domain>`` and
``adcp.types.domains.<domain>.<schema>`` are where the generator defines every
class, and they are a public address — there is no private tree to reach into,
which is why the eight files that used to be listed below as violations now
import legally.

This test enforces a **frozen baseline**: existing violations are listed in
``_KNOWN_VIOLATIONS`` so refactor-them-away can be tackled separately. Any
*new* file or *new* import that bypasses the public surface fails the test.

To shrink the baseline:
- Re-route the import. Only ``adcp.types._generated`` is forbidden; ``adcp``,
  ``adcp.types``, ``adcp.types.domains.<domain>[.<schema>]``,
  ``adcp.types.legacy``, ``adcp.types.aliases``, ``adcp.types.error_details``
  and ``adcp.types.capabilities`` are public and all pass.
- Which one depends on WHY the import is deep, and the two answers differ. If
  the name is merely absent from the flat surface, the surface is incomplete:
  every generated type is declared by the module for the schema that declares
  it, so ``adcp.types.domains...`` serves it. If the name is QUARANTINED — the
  legacy v1 ``format_id`` world is reachable only under explicitly named
  ``Legacy*`` paths, which ``tests/test_canonical_creatives_rc3.py`` asserts —
  then ``adcp.types.legacy`` is the door, and adding the name to the root
  surface is the wrong fix.
- Then remove the file from ``_KNOWN_VIOLATIONS``.
